# Mission Impossible Coding: Minimal, Universal TCP Connect Preflight Check

* **Mission Impossible Code** = Get the job done every time.
* **Minimal** = Smallest amount of code to get the job done (yes this creates friction with "Universal").
* **Universal** = Works on most possible editions / versions of the target environment.
* **Universal** = Frequently provided as both Bash and PowerShell.
* **Universal** = In this case the bash works on Linux and Windows and the PowerShell works on Linux and Windows.
